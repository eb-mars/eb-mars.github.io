                        I have always cared deeply about our enviornment 
                        and I am now looking to apply my skills to challenges 
                        in riverine and steep landscapes on Earth. 
                        A greater understanding of landscape processes 
                        is becoming incraesinly important in the face of human-induced rapid climate change. 
                        I am exploring topics and looking for collaborators, 
                        so please get in contact if you work in this space and want to collaborate!

                    <p class="description">
                        In an ongoing project, we are using Landscape Evolution Modeling
                        to explore the different influences of cratered landscapes and climate on 
                        river networks, as an analog for Mars' past. 
                        This project utilises <a href="https://github.com/espin-2021/Cratering">
                            code that simulates crater topography</a> (after Howward, 2007),
                            and the stream power erosion algorithm from the open-source modeling framework 
                            <a href="https://landlab.csdms.io/"><i>LandLab</i></a>. 
                            Preliminary results indicate that an existing crater topography
                            has a significant effect on the structure and connectivity of 
                            rivers in the landscape, similar in significane to the effects of climate parameters.

                        Hargraves crater, a young fresh crater 120 km upstream of Jezero Crater (the Mars 2020 exploration site), 
                        has two clear sedimentary fan features. 
                        The smaller of these fans has been identified with great confidence as a delta by it's stratigraphic slope break at -800 m (Tebolt & Goudge, 2021),
                        confirming late-stage lake activity on Mars! 
                        Korbin's goal was to determine if the other fan feature appeared similar in morphology, 
                        and/or had a similar topographic slope break (apex point, scarp front), 
                        which would support formation at a similar time, at the same lake level. 
                        The smaller delta apex occurs at -1128 m and the second, larger fan apex is at -1188 m. 
                        The apex elevation similarity supports an interpretation where the fans formed at the same time, 
                        in the same lake about 800m deep.

                        Alexandra's research followed on from that of Laura Arango (2020),
                        with the aim of finishing the mapping of valleys into open basin crater-lakes (OBLs),
                        and to also measure depth of inlet valleys compared to their concordance/discordance with slope. 
                        Unfortunately, we ran into a lot of technical software difficulties, 
                        so the data collection could not proceed, 
                        though Alexandra developed a detailed knowledge of GIS software and methodology! (the hard way...)

                        The source of water that carved Mars' valleys is hotly debated.
                        Valleys carved by runoff (e.g., from rainfall), 
                        should follow local topographic slope, whereas valleys carved by other sources of water
                        (e.g., meltwater beneath glaciers), would be less likely to follow topographic slope. 
                        Laura set out to measure how well the direction of crater-inlet valleys 
                        match with the direction of regional topographic slope, 
                        to begin exploring the possible sources of water for these features. 
                        Preliminary results illustrate that valleys into closed basin crater-lakes (CBLs) are less <i>concordant</i>
                        with slope, compared to valleys into open basin crater-lakes (CBLs).
